## Updates

The code provided with the supplementary materials with the paper was written for an older version of JAGS and will not run under the latest version.

Specifically the problem is that the code provided attempts to deterministically set a value for a stochastic node.

This has been addressed by replacing the deterministic assignment of 0 with a stochastic assignment using `dnorm(0, 1e5)`.

The rest of the code is unchanged.
